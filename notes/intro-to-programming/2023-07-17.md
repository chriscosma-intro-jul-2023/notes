- We got into our VMs
- We created multi-desktops
	- Keyboard shortcut to switch between desktop windows : `Ctrl+Win+(L/R)arrow`
- Look into Excalidraw #todo
- Look into Peacock #todo 
- Angular is the default because it makes it easier to move new developers between projects
	- If there's a good business reason, an argument can be made to use other technologies
- Angular is very opinionated and the way users can interact with the website is going to be similar between projects
## Where do you start?
- When working on a big project, it's hard to get the frontend to match up with the backend perfectly since they rely on each other and it's hard to pick where to start

## Angular
- Installation:
	`npm i -g @angular/cli@latest`
	- @latest is the default if no version is specified
- New standalone app:
	`ng new app --standalone --skip-git --skip-tests`
- Best to open just the root app folder in VS code
- Angular HTML is more like React jsx/tsx
- Angular is for building web apps (SPAs), not web sites
	- Sends bundle to browser with:
		- runtime.js - angular bundle
		- polyfills.js - compatibility with older browsers
		- vendor.js - third party code
- Used for user interfaces

### Components
```ts
@Component({
	standalone: true,             // ?
	selector: 'my-app-component', // one way to include a component in HTML
	imports: [OtherComponent]     // how to specify we can use OtherComponent's selector
})
```

- A unit of user interface in Angular is a Component
	- A TS class
		- A template
		- Both are compiled and sent to the browser
		- Jobs:
			- Accurately project application state
			- Provide affordances through which the user can interact with the application
- State - the value of all meaningful data at a point in time
- Components have children

### Routing
- Pages are things you route to, components are things you use by selector
- You could kind of route with anchor `href` but that's actually reloading the page which is not what we want. Instead, we use `routerLink`.
- We can use `[routerLinkActive]` to set classes based on the active link

## TypeScript
- [TypeScript playground](typescriptlang.org)
- 

## Git
- .gitkeep - Allows git to track an empty folder
- "origin" - conventional name for authoritative copy of git repository
- Create new repo or push existing local to new github repo:
	`gh repo create`
- Good idea to enable periodic git fetch

## VS Code
* Open file side by side:
	`Alt+LClick` on file
- Extension -> Settings icon -> Add to Workspace Recommendations
