- Cluster - multiple computers you treat as one
- Authentication - verifying somebody is who they say they are
	- Authorization - verifying if somebody has access to a certain resource
- Services in the cluster are driven by user applications, e.g., native iOS, Angular app, or MVC app making HTTP requests

## Controllers
- Always have to be a public class
- Have to extend Controller or ControllerBase
- `HttpGet("todo-list")` attribute
	- GET /todo-list -> Create an instance of the TodoListController, call GetTodoList
	- Every request duplicates this process, including creating a new instance of TodoListController
- .NET Apis are concurrent, they can handle x number of simultaneous requests at the same time
- Always return an Object, even if you are just returning a list of stuff, just embed it in an Object
	- Later, lets you add pagination or other options
- Responsible for receiving HTTP requests and returning a response
	- Shouldn't be responsible for making database calls

## Databases
- Postgres can do both relational and object databases
- Object databases, e.g., MongoDB are good at the edge
- Relational databases are good for reporting
- The harder a query is to write, the harder it is for a database to run

## Containers
- Containers address two big problems:
	- Dev/Prod parity - works on one machine, not on another
	- Sharing a server
- The Linux Kernel has "Namespaces" which allows system resources to be partitioned so processes don't use more resources than they're allowed
	- Essential for containers to work

## Async/Await
- I/O bound operations, e.g., database calls, network calls, file system calls

## Services
