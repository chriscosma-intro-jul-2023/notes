- Flux Architecture
	- Components own no data
	- Goes against OOP
	- All data is stored in a global, immutable object (aka. application state)
	- There is only one place in the app that can create a new state
- Components responsibility
	- User interface is components
	- Take some data (state) and make it pretty
		- State is a function of data and time
	- Kind of like a function that given some data, it creates DOM
	- Accurately project the application state to the user
	- Provide affordances in which the user can interact with the application
